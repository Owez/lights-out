# LightsOut

A downtime reporting discord bot for other discord bots. It is designed to be customisable and no-nonsense.

## Running

Install `discord.py` using pip on Python 3.6 or above and run:

```python
python3 lights_out.py
```

It should automatically create the database and startup. LightsOut is not tied to a single guild/bot account and can be possibly cloned onto other accounts to gain more users.
